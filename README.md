# pyFlaskStockServices
Flask Stock Services

These Flask Stock Services will fundamentally provice a RESTful communication layer for a personal stock research and reporting dashboard in which one can create a current portfolio, watch portfolio, review stock history against algoritms and so forth. 

Ideally this tool is focused at people who have some grasp of what the Python language and Flask are and how they are used.
